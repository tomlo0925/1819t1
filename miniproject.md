# IEMS 5780 Mini Project

* Individual project: each student should work on his/her own project
* **Deadline**: 23:59, 22th December, 2018 (Saturday)
* **15%** of the final grade

## Overview

In this mini project, you will build a **machine learning application** utilizing what you have learnt in this course. You are free to choose a topic and a machine learning task in which you are interested.

The machine learning task does not have to be a very complicated one. The focus of this project should be on how the system is designed such that it is **scalable**.

Your system should be implemented using **Python 3.6**. You are free to use any open source packages or libraries in your project.

## Requirements

Your project will be assessed using the criteria listed below:

* **20% - Machine learning functions**
    - You can collect data and train a model for the task
    - You can also use existing pre-trained models available on the Internet, or even packages that implement specific machine learning applications
    - You should provide functions in addition to simply applying the model to the user's input
* **20% - Network programming**
    - Using socket programming, HTTP, or asynchronous messaging to implement clients and servers
* **20% - Concurrent programming**
    - Using multi-threading, multi-processing or asyncio to achieve concurrent execution of tasks
* **20% - System design**
    - Consider which part(s) of the system is the bottleneck
    - Design your system in such a way that it allows horizontal scaling
    - Your system should be able to support multiple concurrent users
* **10% - Robustness**
    - This measures how well your system handle errors or exceptions
* **10% - User Interface**
    - You can use Telegram as your frontend (recommended), or you can develop your own interface using Python, or create a Web-based application

## Suggested Topics

Below are some possible topics for reference:

* Language detection
    - Allow user to type in a sentence in a certain language, the system will detect which language the sentence is written in
* Gender and age prediction
    - Take a photo of a person, and predict the gender and age of the person
* News classification
    - Given a URL to a news article, the system will classify the news article into one of the major categories (e.g. sports, finance, technology, science, etc.)
* Speaker classification
    - Let the user record a voice message in Telegram, the system will classify the speaker into female or male
* Book recommendation
    - Allow users to rate books and the system will recommend new books to the users
* ...

## Submission

You should submit the following files to Blackboard:
* A **README file** containing brief description of each Python script, the dependencies (i.e. open source packages or libraries you have used), and instructions on how to run your programs
* All **source codes**
* **Data files** (if the data is larger than 10MB, upload to cloud storage and include links in the README file)
* A **report in PDF format** of no more than **two pages**, with the following information:
    - Functions/features of your system
    - Description of your machine learning task (e.g. where did you get the data, what ML algorithm did you use, what is the performance of your model)
    - A diagram of the system architecture
    - Description of how your system is designed to be scalable
